Created a Django project with "base" app for handling books and "frontend" app for handling the frontend.

Created a PostgreSQL database and configured it in settings.py to use with the project.

Created a model for books and ran migrations to create the database tables.
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

Created views and serializers to implement the CRUD functionality for the books resource.

Used Bootstrap and CSS to create front-end for using API .

Used JavaScript and AJAX to handle client-side functionality for the front-end.

Tested the API using Postman and it is returning the correct Response.
        List-Books : /book-list/
        Create : /book-create/
        Read : /book-view/<int:pk>/
        Update : /book-update/<int:pk>/
        Delete : /book-delete/<int:pk>/
